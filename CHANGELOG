* 2.13
  - Using latest SDK (8.2.1) while keeping minimum supported API Level to 3.1.0
  - Cleaned build directory and added it to .gitignore
  - Made 'getValue' methods static in PickerGeneric classes
  - Removed unnecessary type casting in 'getInitialView' method
  - Fixed variable reference for plot buffer size in MyViewVarioplot
  - Refactored tone and vibration handling to use boolean flags
  - Updated Kalman filter initialization to use float values
  - Bugfix: Timestamps in Kalman filter updated to integers to match passed values
  
* 2.12
  - Added support for Enduro 1

* 2.11
  - Added an initial, automated altitude calibration upon startup,
    based on the watch-provided altitude

* 2.0
  - Removed features to create My Vario Lite, thus using less memory and more watch
    compatibility
  - Added support for Fenix 5, Fenix 6, Forerunner 645 and Forerunner 935
  - Removed Log view
  - Removed ability to pan and zoom in the varioplot view
  - Removed relative and absolute altitude correction

* 1.4
  - Added the Forerunner 645 Music as a supported watch
  - Added thermal detection option (see USAGE)
  - Added marker of current location on varioplot
  - Limited varioplot to three minutes / 7-9 thermal circling to save memory
  - Replaced General view cell header/unit font to save memory

* 1.32
  - Fixed issue with vario tone frequencies and supported watches

* 1.31
  - Tweak tone curve to have continuous frequency values rather than discrete

* 1.3
  - Added a sink tone along with a sink tone threshold parameter

* 1.2
  - Added a proper tone, frequency, and vibration length curve (not user editable)

* 1.13
  - Fixed bug where vibrations wouldn't be triggered if tones were off

* 1.12
  - Changed activity name to My Vario

* 1.11
  - Added a smoothing parameter for the Kalman filter
  - Removed the GliderSK Lap feature for leaner application

* 1.1
  - Switched from a simple moving average filter to Kalman filter implementation
  - cleaned up all settings related to time constant and filtering

* 1.04
  - Removal of acceleration and rate of turn FIT fields and related filtering
  - Acceleration may be added back in the future, once Gyroscope data becomes
  available in Garmin SDK (for more reactive vario)

* 1.02 & 1.03
  - Amendment to Manifest & Changelog

* 1.01
  - Changed to larger fonts in Varioplot for better visibility while thermalling

* 1.0:
  Changes from GliderSK:
  - Removed Safety features and tones (App should NOT be used for safety)
  - Added vibration Vario for quiet flying
  - Added computation of wind direction speed
  - Changed general view to have wind direction and speed (acceleration and rate of turn removed)
  - Restricted views to General -> Vario -> Vario Plot/Thermal Assistant -> Log (removed other views)
  - Log view is skipped while the activity is recording (e.g. no need to check logs while in flight!)
  - Added auto-switch to Vario Plot when circling, and auto-switch back to previous view when no longer circling
  - Modified some default settings for free flight use-case
  - Added additional vario plot ranges (0.5m/px and 0.25m/px)
  - Added a Minimum Climb setting for vario
  - Removed AutoSpeedStop / Renamed setting to Auto Start (need to stop manually - this is to avoid issues where glider appears to have null ground speed, but still flying)
  - Removed destinations, destination storage, destination import (removes the need for Communications permission)
  - Direction unit added (in degrees, or as direction sector such as NW)
