# My Vario (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
===============================
### A Variometer and tracker application for Garmin ConnectIQ devices


## Overview

This free and open-source application provides Variometer functions adapted
to free flight activities. It is based on the excellent open-source Garmin IQ
GliderSK application by Cedric Dufour (licensed under GPL v3.0, just like My
Vario is), dropping a lot of features for a simpler/leaner experience, while
adding many improvements for free flight activities.

My Vario is a BACKUP source of information and should ALWAYS be paired with
specialized variometer equipment! Watch sensors are simply not precise enough
and THIS APP SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A PRIMARY FLIGHT INSTRUMENT!

1. Dashboards

Multiple views/dashboards are available.

- a Global view, displaying all flight data in a single pane: altitude, ground
and vertical speeds, finesse, heading, wind direction and speed estimate, if
available (wind direction and speed are computed on the fly based on groundspeeds
when circling)

- a Variometer view, where the vertical speed can be visually seen

- a Varioplot/thermal assistant view, allowing to keep track of your ascent/descent
rate along your flight path. This view can optionally include a detected thermal
core to help keep within the thermal

An option to auto-switch to and from the varioplot/thermal assistant view automa-
tically (based on circling auto-detection) is available.

2. Tone and vibration curves

The application makes use of the watch beeps and vibrations (if available).

- Variable-frequency tones to "sound" your ascent rate, as well as vibration-based
"tones" to fly in silence. These tones follow closely some popular variometer tone
curves (sound frequency/pitch, tone to tone or vibration to vibration pause time,
tone/vibration length - all depending on vertical speed)

- a minimum climb rate setting is available, under which sounds or vibrations won't
be triggered

- a sink rate threshold setting is available, for warning of strong sink via a long,
low frequency tone

3. Under the hood

- The application uses a Kalman filter for fast and accurate filtering of altitude
and vertical speed (compared to the SMA filter used by GliderSK originally)

- The smoothing (and latency) applied by the Kalman filter can be changed in the settings

- The default settings are optimized for a comfortable experience out of the box

USAGE:

You really, really want to go through the Manual before first use, and test the
application at home! See below USAGE manual.

## Usage

Please refer to the USAGE file.

## Supported watches

I am using variable frequencytones for the vario, which are only supported for
SDK 3.1.0 and above. This restricts the watches I can support. The My Vario Lite
Application however has had memory optimized to support watches that provie 124kb
of memory to applications (Fenix 5, Fenix 6, Forerunner 645, Forerunner 935, etc.)

## Not a programmer

I am not a programmer nor developer besides some small experience
contributing to N.I.N.A., an open-source astrophotography software suite.
Monkey C, Github, Garming SDK, etc are all new to me. I am a mere tinkerer
playing with and monkeying Cedric's work. It's likely I have introduced
errors, bugs, or code that could be extremely painful to the eyes of
experienced developers. I apologize for the pain caused!
You have been warned!
