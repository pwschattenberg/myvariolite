My Vario (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
===============================
Usage instructions


   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!

   THIS APPLICATION IS NOT TO BE USED AS A MEAN TO INSURE FLIGHT SAFETY.

  Always follow official or recommended procedures to insure flight safety,
         *independently* from the help this application can offer.

  In particular, this application relies on barometric pressure to derive
  the altitude and MUST NOT BE USED IN A PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT.

  WARNING: This app is intended only as an in-flight aid and should not be
  used as a primary information source. This app contains a barometric
  altimeter, it will not function in a pressurized aircraft and should
  not be used in a pressurized aircraft.”

   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!


Getting Started
---------

Upon launch, the application automatically calibrates its raw pressure reading
to match the altitude detected by the watch. As such, if your watch supports maps,
it is a good idea to do a DEM Calibration at takeoff, prior to launching the app.
This is done outside of the app in the watch Settings -> Sensors and Accessories
-> Altimeter -> Calibrate -> Use DEM.

Otherwise, you will need to manually calibrate the altitude after launching My Vario,
as detailed in the Settings section.

After launching the app, if you're confused that the app is not displaying any
data, don't fret! You just need to get a GPS fix :) Go to a window or go outside,
and all will become clear.

Next is navigation. The app is geared towards watches that can be used without
a touch interface, such as Forerunner or Fenix series.

Up button (middle left) and Down button (bottom left) can be used to go from one
view to another. Swiping up and down on a touchscreen also does the trick.

Long pressing the Up button will bring up the menu (except in the Varioplot view!
See the rest of this doc to learn more). You can navigate the menu and its various
settings with the Up, Down, Select (top right button) and Back (bottom right)
buttons. Swipes and taps also work. Check the settings and set them to what you like!

The Select button can be used to start and stop the activity recording, and Back can
be used to exit the app.

Foreword
--------

My Vario relies on your device's raw barometric sensor to compute the altitude,
using the ad-hoc International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formulas and
according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

Upon startup, the application will read the watch altitude (if available) and
calibrate its barometer based on that. If the watch altitude was correct, then
everything is fine, and no further calibration is needed.

If, however you are unsure that your watch altitude is correct, or you know the
exact altitude of takeoff better than the watch does, you should calibrate My
Vario internal altimeter - using either the known QNH or elevation (see Settings
below) - to obtain an accurate altitude reading (besides the initial automated
calibration, the device's "native" altimeter/barometer settings are ignored).

My Vario is based on the excellent GliderSK by Cedric Dufour. If you like this
application, you should consider donating to him (see DONATE file or below).

A lot of this USAGE text is also verbatim from Cedric's manual.

General View
------------

The My Vario General view displays all the flight data in a single view, without
any further bells or whistles:
 - Top-Left:
   estimated wind direction (when available)
 - Top-Right:
   estimated wind speed (when available)
 - Left:
   your current altitude
 - Center:
   your current finesse
 - Right:
   your current (GPS) heading
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current ground speed

Variometer View
---------------

The My Vario Variometer displays your current ascent/descent rate both textu-
ally and graphically, using visually appealing colors:
 - GREEN for ascent
 - RED for descent


Varioplot / Thermal Assistant View
--------------

The My Vario Varioplot / Thermal Assistant graphically displays you ascent/descent
rate along your flight path, using visually appealing colors ranging from:
 - (Bright) GREEN for maximum ascent rate
 - (Bright) RED for maximum descent rate

Unless configured otherwise, the screen will automatically switch to this view
when circling is detected, and switch back to previous view once circling is no
longer detected.

In addition, the following values will be displayed in the corner of the plot:
 - Top-Left:
   your current altitude
 - Top-Right:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current ground speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current finesse

If turned on, the current thermal detected core will be displayed as a blue circle.
See "About Thermal Detection" for more details.

By pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button), you
will enter the Settings menu (see Settings below).

Activity Recording
------------------

Controlling your activity recording status (start, pause, resume, save, discard)
is achieved by pressing the SELECT button.

My Vario adds custom fields to the recorded FIT file:
 - Barometric Altitude
 - Vertical Speed
(which will be plotted in Garmin Connect IF your installed the application
 through the Garmin ConnectIQ store)

For the entire recording session, Garmin Connect will also show the following details:
 - Distance: non-thermalling distance
 - Ascent: cumulative altitude gain and elapsed time spent ascending
 - Minimum Altitude: value and time
 - Maximum Altitude: value and time


!!!! ABOUT ALTITUDE RECORDING !!!!

Note that Garmin doesn't allow applications to overwrite default FIT fields, and as such
there will be two Altitude fields in the generated activity log: the Garmin "official"
altitude, and our (better) barometric altitude field. By default, Garmin watches
attribute pressure changes to either weather or altitude changes. This can cause the
official altitude field to be wildly incorrect compared to our barometric altitude field.

If exporting your log to gpx format and uploading to Ayvri, the Garmin altitude field will
be used (unfortunately), and this can lead to some funky issues. It is thus better to set
the altimeter to Altimeter only in the watch settings before using the application.

This can be done in Settings -> Sensors & Accessories -> Altimeter -> Sensor Mode ->
Altimeter Only.

Settings
--------

Unless explicitely stated otherwise for a given view, you may enter the Settings
menu by pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button).

The application allows you to specify the following settings:

* Altimeter
  > Calibration
    - QNH:
      calibrate the altimeter using the current known QNH
    - Elevation:
      calibrate the altimeter using the current known elevation
      (QNH shall be adjusted accordingly)

    detected, and switch back once circling is no longer detected
  - Thermal Detect (EXPERIMENTAL):
    whether the app will try to detect and map a thermal in the Varioplot view
    see "About thermal detection" for more information
  - Smoothing:
    the amount of smoothing to apply to the variometer reading (determines the standard
    deviation of altitude applied to the Kalman Filter: 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, or 1.0)

  - Timezone:
    display Local Time (LT) or Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z)


About Data Filtering
--------------------

My Vario uses a Kalman Filter for Altitude and Vertical Speed. The filter
was derived from implementations in the SkyDrop vario and Arduino Open Vario.

Other values are not filtered.

The filter currently doesn't use data from the accelerometer, as gyroscope data 
is not yet available from the Garmin SDK. I am planning on adding this for System 5
devices, once SDK 4.1.0 comes out of Beta.

In general, filtered values are used.

Smoothing relies on the standard deviation of the Altitude (which depends on the
barometric sensor). This can be changed via the Variometer Smoothing setting.
Higher values of smoothing induce more lag - however, this still seems to be to
provide better reactivity for the same amount of smoothing as the original
simple moving average of GliderSK.

Note that the Minimum Climb setting can be used to compensate for weaker smoothing,
if using My Vario as an audio/vibration variometer.

However, the Activity Recorded (FIT) data are always instantaneous rather than smoothed.

About Thermal Detection
-----------------------

Thermal detection can be enabled in the settings menu, under Variometer. This performs the
following across the last 60 seconds of location and variometer data:
- It assigns a weight to each location. The stronger the climb at that location the higher
  the weight. However, it also decreases the weight the further that point is from the current
  altitude. The older the data point, the lower its weight as well.
- Locations with a climb rate of less than the Min. Climb setting are ignored
- It computes the weighted average of the coordinates and uses that as the thermal center
- It computes at the same time the weighted standard deviation of the coordinates and uses
  that as the radius of the thermal
- It then draws the thermal as a circle in blue on the varioplot

This feature is experimental, and could be completely useless. Use at your own risk.
If you have a better algo in mind, please let me know!!

WARNING!!! GOTCHAS!!!
---------------------

When using GPS devices, you should be aware that:
 - GPS is very accurate for location (latitude/longitude) information;
   even more so when coupled with GLONASS (at the cost of battery usage).
 - (Garmin) UltraTrac feature is very cool to save battery but does NOT
   refresh location information frequently enough for My Vario purpose.

      !!! DO NOT USE ULTRATRAC WITH MY VARIO !!!

The ConnectIQ framework does NOT allow applications - like My Vario - to
control the location source (GPS, GLONASS and/or UltraTrac). The only way
to circumvent that limitation is to

      !!! USE A NATIVE GARMIN APPLICATION BEFOREHANDS !!!

The ConnectIQ application launched afterwards will then retain those settings.
